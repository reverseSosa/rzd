Kuznetsov elevated the enterprise to a nationwide level, and 'Kuznetsov porcelain' became a national brand.",

				"After the revolution, Kuznetsovo was renamed, apparently considering it was named after a capitalist-industrialist.

				"Hydroelectric power stations dammed the Volga, providing electric power to enterprises in the Moscow region. In these places, a dam was built, forming the Ivan'kovo Reservoir, or as it was elegantly called, the Moscow Sea. Unfortunately, the ancient town of Korcheva ended up underwater. The status of the district center was transferred to Konakovo, and in 1937, it became a city.",

Few passengers have always got off and on here. It was even closed for a couple of years, but the launch of the Moscow Central Circle breathed new life into the platform. Since December 2016, all regular electric trains have been required to stop here to 'intercept' the passenger flow arriving in Moscow.",

Yes, the railway engineer was such a respected and well-paid specialist that he could afford to maintain his own estate. Moreover, he was not just an engineer but a count. He received his noble title and land for the estate personally from Nicholas I, in gratitude for the construction of the Nikolayevskaya railway line from Khovrino to Kryukovo. Podrezkov was the mastermind behind it all.",

However, the western part of Novopodrezkovo remained in the Khimki district, that is, in the Moscow region.",

Yes, the railway engineer was such a respected and well-paid specialist that he could afford to maintain his own estate. Moreover, he was not just an engineer but a count. He received his noble title and land for the estate personally from Nicholas I, in gratitude for the construction of the Nikolayevskaya railway line from Khovrino to Kryukovo. Podrezkov was the mastermind behind it all.",

Its tall buildings are clearly visible to the right from the train.",

For some unknown reason, eight streets in the eastern part of the settlement of Novopodrezkovo (which amounts to about 200 private houses) became part of Moscow, in the current Molzhaninovsky district. However, the western part of Novopodrezkovo remained in the Khimki district, that is, in the Moscow region.",

Initially, in the 1950s-1960s, the road was indeed built from concrete slabs and was intended exclusively for the transfer of air defense means and other military equipment around Moscow. It was not marked on any civilian map. But resourceful dacha owners gradually began to explore this ghostly road. As a result, it had to be officially recognized, asphalted, and put on the map. This happened for the first time in 1991.",

The largest among them are Shosha, Lama, and Yauza. The riverbanks are low here, swamps are widespread, and there are many lakes. It is not surprising that the fauna of the reserve is exceptionally rich - more than 40 species of mammals, as well as countless birds and fish. A real paradise for hunters and fishermen.",

During visits to the USSR, Joseph Broz Tito, Fidel Castro, Erich Honecker, President of Finland Urho Kekkonen, and Janos Kadar would always stop by here. During the leadership of Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev, the territory was constantly expanding.",

				"Among its numerous owners, a special place is occupied by General Dmitry Alexeevich Stolypin, the paternal uncle of Mikhail Lermontov's grandmother. As we remember from the school bench, grandmother Elizaveta Alexeevna replaced the poet's parents. From 1829 to 1832, young Lermontov spent his summer months here with his grandmother. In the tranquility of the estate, he read Pushkin, Byron, heard live folk speech, and began to write his first poems.",

				"In 1869, the estate passed to the merchant Ivan Firsanov. His name is still carried by the railway platform, miraculously avoiding any renaming. The merchant's daughter Vera Firsanova was very educated. Guests to Vera Ivanovna, a lover and connoisseur of art, included the singer Fyodor Chaliapin, composers Sergei Rachmaninoff and Julius Konyus, and artists Valentin Serov and Konstantin Yuon.",

			seventhP:
				"Thanks to the fact that there has always been an elite holiday home here, Serednikovo has been well preserved. Since 1992, the National Lermontov Center has been developing here. Anyone can visit the estate. Moreover, this is a place of pilgrimage for fans of the series 'Closed School.' It was filmed here.",

				"Khovrino Station is the youngest on our route. It was opened in November 2020. Previously, it was called the modern platform 'Grachyovskaya'.",
			secondP:
				"It was decided to create a new transport hub at this location. Its foundation was laid by the newly opened metro station with the same name at that time. Nearby is the large international bus station 'Severnye Vorota'. Thus, the groundwork was laid for the then planned MCD-3 line.",
			thirdP:
				"The name Khovrino preserves the name of the ancient estate for us. Its main manor house on Klin Street has been preserved. According to one version, the Khovrin family, who founded the settlement, is derived from the Byzantine Komnin dynasty. Gradually, Komnin could have transformed into 'Komrin' and then into 'Khovrin'.",

				"Today, Khovrino Station is part of the MCD-3, also known as the Leningradsko-Kazansky Diameter.",

				"The idea of using suburban railways as part of the intracity transport system has proven itself in the world's largest cities. In Moscow too, the issue of creating intracity railways was raised multiple times before the revolution and in the 1930s. The project for the through movement of suburban trains through Moscow was included in the 1971 master plan.",
			sixthP:
				"However, it wasn't until 2017 that serious planning began. It was necessary to do a huge amount of work: build modern pavilions, relay tracks, create new stops, and even relocate some.",
			seventhP:
				"In 2019, the First and Second Central Diameters were opened. They are also known as the 'Belorussko-Savelovskiy' and 'Kursko-Rizhskiy'. In 2023, it is the turn of the Third and Fourth diameters. The length of the MCD-3, part of which we are traveling on, is 85 kilometers. In addition to the 'Khovrino' station, it includes 41 stations. Along the Leningrad direction, the Third Diameter is extended to Zelenograd.",

				"The railway here, as in many other places, runs straight through the forest, and this is not a coincidence.",
			thirdP:
				"Let's remember how the railway between Moscow and St. Petersburg was built. It was indeed laid through impenetrable forests, connecting the Russian capitals via the shortest route, ignoring historically established roads. If a major city was on the route, and especially if it happened to be at the 1st or 2nd-class station, it was all the better for the city. In towns that were off the railway line, life quieted down.",
			fourthP:
				"Let's recall what the journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow was like in the time of Nicholas I. By then, the two capitals were connected not just by a road but by a highway, meaning a road with a relatively solid gravel surface. Diligences - huge carriages for four people - were used as public transport since 1820. Horses were changed 25 times on the 720 km journey, and it took a week for the exhausted passengers to reach the capital. A ticket cost 95 rubles, which was a fortune at the time, as one could buy a calf for two rubles. For the less well-off public, `sidyorki` appeared over time - the same diligences but for 14 passengers, with tickets priced from 3 to 5 rubles.",
			fifthP:
				"We owe the appearance of a much more convenient and faster communication between the cities to the outstanding Russian engineer Pyotr Pavlovich Melnikov. He was a rare example of a combination of high education, organizational skills, and exceptional nobility. With these qualities, Melnikov managed to rise to the position of Minister of Ways of Communication and lived to a ripe old age.",
			sixthP:
				"So, in 1837, the engineer P.P. Melnikov and his student Kerbedz went to Europe for a year and a half to study the experience of building railways (both sponsored by Nicholas I himself). Note that Melnikov was only 26 at the time. Upon their return, a report of five volumes on 1,500 pages was compiled.",
			seventhP:
				"Almost immediately after that, Melnikov and another colleague, Professor O.N. Kraft, went to the United States for another year and a half. And another five volumes on 1,500 pages. The conclusion was that the construction of the road between Moscow and St. Petersburg, with the right organization, would be economically efficient. The reports of the young engineer circulated from one government department to another, while Melnikov and Kraft developed a project for the construction of the road between Moscow and St. Petersburg.",
